# **I. Overview & Context**

### **The Current Crisis: Platform Fragmentation**

Webtoon’s ecosystem (2024–2025) presents a paradox: while **mobile engagement** reached record highs, the **desktop web experience** declined sharply, fragmenting the user journey across devices.

* **Mobile consumption:** \~77% of all sessions (↑10–12% from pre-redesign levels)

* **Avg. mobile session:** 22.5 min (+22% from 18.4 min in 2024\)

* **Desktop decline:** 8–12% drop in usage, 7–10% shorter sessions

* **Web bounce rate:** ↑10–15%, highest among first-time visitors

* **Creator sentiment:** “Discoverability is very low in Webtoon Canvas now.” *(r/WebtoonCanvas, 2024, \~600 upvotes)*

The **2024 mobile-first UI overhaul** (TikTok-style video previews, simplified layouts) prioritized mobile optimization but **undermined the desktop experience**—removing the prominent *Hero Banner* and shrinking the Canvas section from the bold *“CANVAS: Discover stories”* branding to a minimal *“More stories from indie creators”* row featuring only six visible series.

**Platform Focus Clarification:**  
 While Webtoon’s **mobile application** continues to perform strongly—accounting for \~77% of total consumption with optimized vertical scrolling and intuitive native design—this transformation specifically targets the **crisis-level deficiencies in the web platform** (desktop \+ mobile web).  
 The mobile app serves as the **baseline UX reference** for interaction design, whereas the web experience must be structurally rebuilt to achieve parity and ultimately surpass mobile by leveraging desktop-specific strengths (multi-window navigation, expanded layouts, integrated community modules).
